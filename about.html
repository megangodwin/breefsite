		<h2>Barrier Reef Orchestra </h2>
		<h3>Barrier Reef Orchestra is a product of North Queensland Ensembles Inc. </h3>
		<p>North Queensland Ensembles Inc. is a Queensland registered Incorporated Association, including a tax deductible fund which can be found on the Register of Cultural Organisations under the Subdivision 30-B of the Income tax Assessment Act 1997, being based in Townsville.  </p>
	  	<h3>Minor History and Information</h3>
	  	<p>During a pretentious 2 year long period in the late nineties, a small group of Townsville located musicians, art workers and other people with similar hobbies and realisations, saw the potential of a community based Orchestra – an orchestra that would flourish and soon be known throughout musicians, artists and the general public. <br><br>
		The Barrier Reef Orchestra generally performs at least 3 times in a typical year, with guest conductors and other performing groups. A large majority of our concerts are held at the Tonsville Civic Theatre as it has adequate performing space and provided seating for the audience. All of the players involved in BRO are quite varied, with players coming from all walks of life and from different parts of the World - some including: Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane and London.</p>
