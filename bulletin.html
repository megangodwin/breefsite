		Dance and music go together likee a, ahem, horse and carriage or in 2016 a iPhone and a thumb! But unlike the old song you certainly can have one without the other and the Barrier Reef Orchestra's first concert for the year Dreams and Dances definitely proved that.

		Those among us in the capacity audience in the Civic theatre to celebrate Townsville's 150th anniversary had a real treat of a birthday present. The Variety concert would have had about 97% Townsville connected content and showcased what talent is in Townsville.
