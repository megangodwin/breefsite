<h1>Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Barrier Reef Orchestra Site Plan - Group Task</h2>
<h3>Group members: Megan Godwin, Dylan Wharton, Connor Bettini</h3>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>Our goal for creating this website are to create a new and more   effective design that will be less confusing and more user friendly in   order to boost traffic on the website. This will be done by designing a   less cluttered layout with clear and simple navigation as to make sure   the user will not get confused. We aim to display information more   clearly on the website so the user will have to spend less time   searching for the information they want. We also aim to make it easier   for anyone interested in joining the orchestra to contact the orchestra   manager.<br>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
The website will target a younger audience (typically   those more interested in music) in order to bring a younger group of   people into the orchestra, as well as the older generation as they make up the majority of the orchestra's audience.</p>
